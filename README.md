## About
This program intends to use the automate proxy creation using a user's vultr.com API key. By default, it attempts to create 10 proxies. Most accounts will be limited to a max number of servers unless a limit increase is requested (explained below). Once proxies are created by the program, they should be ready for use within a few minutes. Ideally you want to select a location as close as possible to your server (Chicago usually has fastest ping for Shopify). When you're done, make sure to destroy your servers.

DM me (@snivynGOD) if you want any specific changes (ex. more than 5 proxies at a time, change user/password).

### How do I destroy my servers and what does that entail?
Destroying your servers basically means to delete them. You'll still be charged if you stop them but you won't be charged if you destroy them. To do this, login to Vultr, go to my.vultr.com, and beside every server, click the 3 dots on the right side, hit "Destroy Server" and the server will be destroyed.
